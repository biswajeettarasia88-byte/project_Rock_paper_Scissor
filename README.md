This project is a command-line Rock Paper Scissors game developed using Python, where a user plays against the computer. The computer randomly selects between rock, paper, or scissors, and the game logic determines the winner based on standard rules.

The project is designed to demonstrate basic Python programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, user input handling, and random number generation. It is ideal for beginners who want hands-on practice with Python through a fun and interactive game.
